## Introduction:

More people are using electricity than ever before as an essential part of modern life. The use of energy is important for operating all appliances, entertainment, and technology. Global energy consumption has increased the individual’s standard of living. But electricity generation is damaging the environment. Electricity in most countries is generated by coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy. They all emit CO2 and other emissions when burned. Carbon emissions are dangerous to humans, the planet, and our future. As non-renewable resources, they have limited supply and cannot be sustained. Therefore, many countries are moving towards renewable sources such as hydropower, biomass, wind, geothermal and solar power. Providing clean and reliable power supplies that will help conserve the resources.

## Access to Electricity

Globally access to electricity has been steadily rising over the decades and has begun to accelerate in developing countries. By 2016, the majority of the world population had access to electricity. Access to electricity indicates the social and economic growth of the country. And an undistorted indication of a country’s energy power status.
